Last week we hired North Raleigh Tree to come look at a tree we had right next to our house that looked questionable.
You took the time to study the tree thoroughly and pointed out the dangers of the tree.  Sure enough, as your team took the tree down, the exact weak spot you pointed out shattered ... fortunately, it was under a controlled environment and not during the next wind storm.
Your team cleaned the entire yard thoroughly in record time.  I was able to fire up the John Deere in no time and cut the lawn right where your team was working.  That evening from the back deck, the yard looked fantastic.
 
Much Appreciated,  Job Well Done!

North Raleigh Tree stood out from the rest of their competitors from the very beginning. They evaluated our daunting yard situation, specifically asked about our desired outcome and vision for our yard, and made knowledgeable recommendations on which trees to keep and which to remove. They removed 15 trees in close proximity to our house, deck and shed with calculated expertise. They were careful around existing landscaping and I appreciated their constant communication with me throughout the entire process. I highly recommend North Raleigh Tree to all my friends and neighbors. Not only did they do a great and efficient job in a timely manner, but the entire crew was pleasant and they thoroughly cleaned up afterwards (even hosing off the driveway).

 A big thank you to Kevin and his whole team!
